    "This sushi restaurant was a great find. No frills, just fresh ingredients! They had free green tea which was lovely, we had the spicy miso soup which is a must have if you visit. Followed by inari, tuna, eel, and sockeye salmon nigiri. Super fresh, perfect proportions, we couldnâ€™t ask for more. You can tell that the chef and restaurant owners/staff take pride in their product.",
    "Very nice sushi place. I gravitate toward this place because of the good staff and quality food they make. I always love it more then other spots locally and like i said the staff, and ordering is easy and great. I always tell people its a good place and they agree or take my strong word for the good sushi. Always thinking of getting sams and will be going until the end.",
    "BEST sushi. Great non sushi options. Chicken teriyaki is my spouses favourite! Sam is wonderful as are the other people there! Always love sushi night! Thanks guys!",
    "Sams Sushi is easily the best sushi I have tried in the Oceanside area. They are closed on the weekends, so be sure to order your takeout during the week. I suggest to call in your order and choosing a pickup time. Amazing customer service!",
    "I get take-out from Sam's Sushi and the fish has always been fresh and delicious. I can get rolls with brown rice. This is a great spot.",
    "Excellent sushi and tempura. The mixed tempura had delicious prawns and a good mix of veg. We went for the mixed sushi too. Again a good combination. The scallop melted in the mouth. Staff were super nice and friendly. Price was decent too. Highly recommended!",
    "The very best sushi I've ever enjoyed.  Salmon and Tuna were smooth and delectable.  :)"

    "Place is OK but they can't keep up to demand. I've ordered 3 times  hours before closing and they say sold out.... not worth the hassle.",
    "I'm not sure what everyone is going on about..overpriced sub par sushi..the portions were made for midgets. I mean little people..very dissapointing..30 bucks for us two and now we have to go out for sushi somewhere..probably would have cost 100 bucks to get full..pathetic.",
    "Easy parking, good service, ordinary sushi. OK but wouldn't go back.",
    "The service was quite attentive. The food was good, just not stellar.",
    "Sushi seems to be getting smaller and more expensive.",
    "Why do other people recommend this sushi place? I ordered here in the past and had my regrets. Then I decided to give it another try. Maybe the first time was a bad luck. We spent over $70 on our recent order. Short story... 1. not fresh 2. very small sushi bites 3. cream-cheese roll had barely any cream cheese 4. sake maki (salmon rolls) were half rice with semi-dry colored salmon 5. some rolls had a bad smell 6. semi-dry red ginger. I could go on... We are frustrated again and definitely don't recommend this place. Waste of both money and food experience.",
    "Not as good as usual quality seems to have dropped.",
    "Was p okay. Nothing to write home about."
